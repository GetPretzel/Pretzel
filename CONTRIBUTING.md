# Contributing
:+1: :tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada: :+1:

Pretzel is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community â€” you! There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting UI translations, bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into Pretzel itself.

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Pretzel and its packages, which are hosted on the [Pretzel group](https://gitlab.com/getpretzel/) on GitLab and the [Pretzel organization](https://github.com/GetPretzel/) on GitHub. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Getting Started
Checkout the [wiki](https://gitlab.com/getpretzel/pretzel/-/wikis/home) which contains things like the code style, architecture, patterns, UI/UX design and more.
